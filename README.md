# vue-img-gallery-and-carousel

Demo: https://timardex.github.io/vue-img-gallery-and-carousel/

## How does it work?
Before you use this project you need to insert some `.jpg` images inside `assets/img` folder. 

The filename of the images should be like this: `CategoryName-Title`.jpg example `Architecture-House-with-pool`

The code will check for the contents in that folder and will put them into an array and than will list it inside the project.
`CategoryName` is important as that will be inserted automaticly into the category filter component.

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
